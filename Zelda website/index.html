				<p class="lore-text">The sole victor of the imprisoning war. At this point, Ganon had suffered a defeat at the hands of a previous incarnation of Link and was sealed away by the magic of the sages. Somehow, the triforce of power fell into his hands once again, but this had no effect on his seal. Eventually, Yuga broke the seal on Ganon and merged with him.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Although Zelda was the wielder of the triforce of wisdom, she played a relatively minor role in this adventure. Yuga's plan to free Ganon and capture the sages went off with little resistance. Zelda herself was transformed into a painting, which was eventually placed in the possession of Princess Hilda.</p>

				<p class="lore-text">At the beginning, Link was simply a blacksmith's assistant. Yuga's actions forced him to embark on an adventure that would decide the fate of both Lorule and Hyrule. Through the many trials he endured, Link earned the Triforce of Courage. What he didn't know was that everything that had happened, even the fact that he obtained the triforce piece, was all a part of Princess Hilda's scheme.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Acting on Hilda's orders, Yuga traveled to Hyrule and captured the sages. Merging with Ganon was only part of the plan. Everything Yuga did was supposed to result in Hilda stealing Hyrule's triforce for the sake of her dying kingdom. However, Yuga cared little for either kingdom, and eventually acted on his own ambitions.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Princess Hilda inherited the dying kingdom of Lorule. She bared the blame for her family's decision to destroy Lorule's triforce and put an end to the wars. It was her idea to steal Hyrule's triforce and save Lorule. She plotted with Yuga to do so, eventually taking Zelda's Triforce of Wisdom for herself.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Ravio was a simple merchant in Lorule. He knew about Hilda's plan and how she intended to work with Yuga. He opposed all of it, but he lacked the courage to challenge either her or Yuga directly. So he traveled to Hyrule to seek aid. The bracelet Ravio gave to Link played a crucial role in the fate of the two kingdoms.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Calamity Ganon, known to the denizens of this era of Hyrule as the cause Great Calamity, is the raw manifestation of the malice that has plagued the kingdom for thousands of years. It is unknown if this incarnation of evil ever possessed the triforce of power at all. Regardless of whether or not he did, Ganon was still able to easily bring Hyrule to ruin by extending his will over the very weapons the kingdom built to protect themselves from him. He wiped out almost all of Hyrule's defenses in an instant, and only Zelda herself was able to delay him at all.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">With the return of Ganon on the horizon, Zelda's father placed pressure on her to unlock the sealing powers that would be crucial in defeating Ganon. However, Zelda never felt any connection at all to Nayru, and she had no one to guide her. When she made no headway in obtaining these powers, she placed her efforts into studying the ancient Sheikah shrines and the Divine Beasts. Unfortunately, this would not be enough to stop Ganon.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">A knight of Hyrule, and the hero chosen by the Master Sword. Link was unable to defeat Ganon's forces on the day of the Great Calamity. He defended Zelda for as long as she could, eventually collapsing due to the wounds he received. Right before she headed off to face Ganon alone, she had Link's body placed in the shrine of ressurection. It took roughly one hundred years for his wounds to heal.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Ganondorf, the King of the Gerudo Thieves. Hiding his true intentions, Ganondorf formed an alliance with the King of Hyrule and gained his trust. Through using both Link and Zelda, he was able to enter the sacred realm and claim the triforce of power as his own. This was enough to enable him to lay claim to Hyrule, but for seven long years, the other two pieces would be lost to him.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">A hylian boy who grew up under the protection of the Great Deku Tree in Kokiri forest. As a child, Link worked with Zelda to thwart Ganondorf's efforts. And as an adult, he worked with her once more to undo the damage the Great King of Evil had inflicted upon Hyrule. Only after he climbed Ganon's tower did the Triforce of Courage reveal itself within him.</p>

				</button>
				<p class="lore-text">Zelda was the only one who did not trust Ganondorf from the start. Her plan to lay claim to the triforce before he did would have worked, but she could not foresee Ganondorf's pre-emptive attck. Nor did she know the true nature of the sacred realm. Although she continued to fight against his forces in the future, she blamed herself for her kingdom's downfall, and for Link's fate. </p>
